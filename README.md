# Venym AI - Solana Vanity Wallet Generator

This tool generates Solana vanity wallet addresses. A vanity address is a cryptocurrency wallet address that contains a specific pattern or word, making it more personalized and recognizable.

## Installation

This script requires the following Python libraries:

-   `nacl`: For cryptographic operations (specifically, `PyNaCl`).
-   `base58`: For Base58 encoding/decoding.

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pynacl base58
```

## Usage

1.  Run the script: `python Venym_Wallet_Generator.py`
2.  Follow the prompts:
    -   **Matching Type:** Choose where the desired pattern should appear in the address:
        -   `front`: Pattern at the beginning.
        -   `back`: Pattern at the end.
        -   `both`: Pattern at both the beginning and end.
        -   `any`: Pattern at either the beginning or the end.
    -   **Pattern:** Enter the desired pattern (e.g., "venym").
    -   **Case Sensitivity:** Choose whether the pattern matching should be case-sensitive (`y`) or not (`n`).
3.  The script will generate key pairs until it finds a match. This may take some time, depending on the complexity of the pattern.
4.  Once a match is found, the script will display:
    -   The matching wallet address.
    -   The private key in Base58 format. **Keep this private key extremely safe!** Anyone with access to this key can control the funds in the wallet.
